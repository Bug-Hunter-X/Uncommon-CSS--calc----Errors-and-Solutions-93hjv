The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS.  However, it's easy to introduce errors if you don't follow the correct syntax or handle unexpected values. For example, forgetting spaces around operators can cause unexpected behavior.  Another common issue is trying to use `calc()` with units that aren't compatible.  Finally, browser compatibility can occasionally be a factor, though most modern browsers support the majority of the specification.
